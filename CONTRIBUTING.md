# No National Defense Participation

Due to our need to comply with ITAR, EAR, and the export laws of other nations, we can not allow the participation for the purpose of creating devices or services for national defense. This would expose us to regulation that would prevent international collaboration on our projects.

Individuals employed by defense vendors or national governments who are clearly working on defense projects may not post to the mailing lists and discussion forums or upload to ORI sites.

Participation for national disaster preparedness and response (for example, by FEMA in the U.S. and many Amateur Radio organizations worldwide) is allowed and encouraged. Defense vendors may be required to demonstrate that they are working on a contract with a national disaster preparedness organization such as FEMA.

The Problem From The Radio Amateur Viewpoint

Many of our wireless projects are for use by Radio Amateurs (“ham radio” operators). Each nation regulates the use of particular communication technologies by their Radio Amateurs. Digital communications are particularly subject to regulation, because of the potential for them to be used with encryption and the special equipment necessary for a national regulator to receive them. So that nations continue to authorize use of our work on the air by their Radio Amateurs, our projects must clearly not be for any military purpose.

When Radio Amateurs participate in DX-peditions, they travel to another nation for the purpose of making on-air contacts from an area that has few or no local ham radio operators. Hams collect contacts from such rare and distant locations, and thus appreciate the Amateurs who go to those places and make contacts from them with other hams worldwide. The local governments whose nations are visited by DX-peditions must be assured that the hams are not spies and are not there for any military purpose. Often local governments are unfamiliar with the technology that is brought on DX-peditions, and fearful because they do not own any means to receive and decode the signals – especially in the case of ORI’s digital communications projects, which may be seen as cryptography even when signals are actually sent in the clear.

Suspicion of Radio Amateurs by national governments has resulted in their imprisonment in various countries and could even result in execution. More often it results in the government suddenly rescinding the privilege of operating in their nation, often after the hams have gone to great expense to travel to an inaccessible place, chartering ships or aircraft and bringing lots of large and heavy equipment.  ORI works to prevent such suspicion by maintaining its projects as clearly non-military.

# What To Do

Participation for defense purposes often first shows as a posting to a mailing list or discussion forum by an individual from their workplace, where the workplace is clearly involved in creating defense hardware or services for its national government. If you notice such a communication, don’t answer it. Check to see if the vendor is on the list of Admitted Defense Vendors, which will state the non-defense project they are working on. If they’re not on the list, refer the issue to the officer in ORI charged with denying defense participation (currently Bruce Perens K6BP, bruce at perens dot com).

If a defense contractor seeks to participate in an ORI project, they must be able to provide proof of a non-military purpose (for example, public record of an active contract with FEMA, NIST, NOAA, etc.,). We may require additional documentation, and the ORI board retains the right to accept or reject the organization at its discretion.

If the intended participation is military in nature, we will ask the group to desist, or electronically bar them from doing so, and share the related communications with the appropriate authorities.

# Keep It Public

ORI’s protection from export restrictions such as ITAR and EAR depends on all work being made available to the public. Developers and other participants are encouraged to carry out discussions related to ORI projects in an online forum that is archived on the ORI web site. Development of software or textual data should be checked in to our git repository each day that the developer works on the project. Please make sure that every aspect of all of our projects is available to the public.

# Transfer of Physical Objects Restricted Under ITAR or EAR

Our ITAR and EAR policy protects us from being regulated under ITAR and EAR when we share computer data, including software and designs, internationally. It does not protect us when we transfer physical objects that are regulated under ITAR and EAR to non-US-nationals or across national borders.

Physical objects which are probably subject to ITAR and EAR and which may require an export license include, but are not limited to: space communications, space satellites, rocketry, encryption.

When you need to transfer this sort of material, please contact the board of directors.

Countries on the ITAR embargoed list will probably have export licenses denied. At this writing, these are: Afghanistan, Belarus, Central African Republic, Cuba, Cyprus, Eritrea, Fiji, Iran, Iraq, Cote d’Ivoire, Lebanon, Libya, North Korea, Syria, Vietnam, Myanmar, China, Haiti, Liberia, Rwanda, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Republic of the Sudan (Northern Sudan), Yemen, Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Democratic Republic of the Congo.
