Oh look what you found? Want to make your own? Well you can!

SCREEN ANIMATIONS

Grab any square gif, don't worry, non-square are okay if you crop or letterbox.

We've traded SD storage for pure speed and FPS. Theoretically there is no max
size for the code, you're only limited to the SD card. Each frame uses 32.8kB.

To do the conversion we used ffmpeg on Linux. It may work on Windows but that's
your job to figure out.

Convert animated gif to raw video format:
ffmpeg -i BACKERS.gif -r 22 -f rawvideo -s 128x128 -pix_fmt rgb565be BACKERS.RAW



===============================================================================
LED ANIMATIONS

Wait? Wut? Yes, you can animate the LEDs too. This takes some effort, but we
know you're up for the challenge.

Key here is to select an animation with a 5x4 ratio. Seamless looping
animations work best. Highly saturated images will need to be darkened and 
toned down to look right on the LEDs. Dark images will need to be brightened.

Convert animated gif to RGB file for LED animation:
ffmpeg -i flames-small.gif -r 20 -f rawvideo -s 5x4 -pix_fmt rgb24 FLAMES.RGB



===============================================================================
USAGE

Place the .RAW and .RGB file(s) into /BLING directory. The "Custom" bling tool
will see these and add them to the menus.

If you come up with something good, please share it.
